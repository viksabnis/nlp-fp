Standalone and Shared-Library REPP Implementation

LICENSE
This software is free for all to use, under the terms of the LGPL (see: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).

INSTALLATION
Simply run "./configure && make && make install".  Note that "make install" may require suitable privileges.

STANDALONE USAGE
The "repp" executable loads ".rpp" files and processes utterances on standard input, one per line.  Usage is:

repp path-to-main-module.rpp -m path-to-submodule1.rpp -m path-to-submodule2.rpp [-y]

By default, "repp" will preprocess each input utterance and show the output tokens delimitted by spaces.

If you pass "-y", the output will be in "YY" format, suitable for input to PET.

SHARED-LIBRARY
Other applications can link against librepp.so and include <librepp.h>.

The best documentation of the API is the function prototypes in the header file librepp.h -- it is not particularly complicated.

BUGS
The software probably has some bugs, since it is an early release.  Please to contact me <sweaglesw@sweaglesw.org> if you find them.
